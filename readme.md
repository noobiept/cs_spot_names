Info
====

A counter-strike mini-game, where you need to choose the correct spot of the map.

In the normal mode, you get a random map, and go through all the spots in the map (in random order as well), until you get them all right. Same thing for the remaining maps until you go through all. You'll have a score that is dependent in the number of correct/incorrect choices, and the time it took to finish all maps.

In practice mode, you select a specific map and play through all the spots. There's no end to it, since its just to practice.
